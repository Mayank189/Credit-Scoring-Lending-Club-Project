# Credit-Scoring-Lending-Club-Project

# Predictive Model for bank to predict which type of customer will not pay back the default loan on credit card.

# Stages of Credit Lifecycle : Acquisations,EarlyEngagement,Customer Management and Customer Attrition.

# This POC is created under Acquisation lifecycle where we study past application build model and come up with 
strategy before giving/assigning loan on credit card to the customer by analyzing the historical/past datasets.

# This will help business in near future before giving loan to customer based on certain parameter and will try to minimize its default rate.

# Important target(dependent) variables in datasets -Default,Charged off and Does not meet the credit policy.
